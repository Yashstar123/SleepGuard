# SleepGuard - Drowsiness Detection Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning

The Project aims to identify drowsiness of the user using the OpenCV and mediapipe holistic libraries using the fundamentals of Computer Vision.

The project takes various landmarks of the user as input such as face,hand and pose landmarks using mediapipe holistic. Then pre-processing and feature engineering is performed on the given data. Finally various machine learning algorithms are applied on the training samples like Voting Classifier, Linear Support Classifer,Adaboost etc. 

Then different models are used to predict whether the given user is active and drowsy.
